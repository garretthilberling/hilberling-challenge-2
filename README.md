# Garrett Hilberling Professional Portfolio

## Description
For this project we were tasked with desigining an online portfolio from scratch. This challenge solidified what informaton on CSS we have learned thus far. Namely flexbox. The page was designed with visuals first and formost being the focus. We were given a mock up that I tried my best to replicate but put my own spin on. I have a long way to go but I am proud of this work and spent a long time ensuring it was presentable. 

## Installation
No installation required, access the application at the live URL via this link: https://garretthilberling.github.io/hilberling-challenge-2/

## Usage
The format on this page is pretty standard. I added a few things I felt made the experience more engaging. Firstly I addressed what we were instructed to and ensured the links in the navigation bar led to their respective sections, made the images linking to my work slightly transparent, and restored full opacity upon the viewer hovering over the images. I also have my name linking to my LinkedIn account, made it so when you hover over the navbar list items it is highlighted using background color, hovering over my profile picture causes it to expand in size, and clicking my resume takes the user to a new page to view the entire PDF file.
